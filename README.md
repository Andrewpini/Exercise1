Exercise 1 : Hello World
========================

This exercise does not require that you use the machines at the real-time lab. However, the C code uses POSIX, so you'll need a POSIX-compliant OS, like linux or OSX.

[Go](http://golang.org) has an [interactive "Tour"](http://tour.golang.org/list) you can take. Go's syntax is a bit different, so it may be worth skimming through, or at least using as a quick reference.
